# Calculate Network bandwidth for Teams use and configure profiles for Teams devices.

## Introduction

A while ago I heard somebody talk about figuring a network's bandwidth before deploying teams to make sure the infrastructure meet the requirements for Microsoft Teams services.
With the Team admin portal we can accomplish that without much trouble. We will also cover how to configure profiles before deploying Teams devices. (e.g. Teams deskphones, headphones, Meeting rooms, and more.

## Use Case

In reality, before deploying Teams you would like to know the network bandwidth available to see if it meets the requirements to use Teams services. You won't want your users to have constant lag of their video conference. By inputting your user count and expected user behavior, the resulting calculation will better prepare you to successfully deploy Microsoft Teams in your environment. You can do bandwidth calculations based on maximum or average bandwidth numbers; the calculator leverages average values to do the calculations. You can calculate bandwidth for both private one-on-one calls as well as group calls.I also learned how to create a configuration profile for Teams devices. 

## Cloud Research

After running the Network bandwidth tool for Teams, I got a better understanding of the impact of Teams on the network with a nice Chart that the service provides after.

The configuration profile for Teams devices was pretty straight forward. I was unable to verify the configuration since I don't have a Teams device available at the moment of doing this lab.
