# Investigate Microsoft 365 Data

## Introduction

I worked on this lab because I wanted to learn how to investigate the data that's being shared internally in any organization using Microsoft 365 services. How about if sensitive information is being shared internally and the admins don't know about it? Learning how to use this tool can help us with legal and compliance investigations.

## Use Case

With Microsoft 365 eDiscovery service we can identify deleted emails, Teams conversations, OneDrive data and more. For example, we can create and eDiscovery case that finds if Social Security Numbers have been shared in the organization. Another case could be a legal investigation and we need to provide data of an specific employee to Law enforcement.

## Cloud Research

In this lab I learned to created an eDiscovery case, added an In-Place Hold to preserve mailbox content, and created a search to discover data from the hold.
