# Configure Self-service password reset (SSPR)

## Introduction

- Today I learned how to configure Self-service password reset (SSPR). With this tool we can help users reset their passwords whenever they want.

## Use Case

- SSPR tools can help users reset their passwords whenever they want without having to open a Ticket with their HelpDesk. Using factors as a mobile or hardware token before a user can access a password self-service portal multi-factor authentication verifies that the user is the actual owner of the password something which cannot be done with passwords alone or other authentication methods.

## Cloud Research

- I investigated about the benefits of SSPR and ways to secure the tool by enabling Multi factor authentication. After configuring the tool on my MS365 tenant, I confirmed it worked how it should and MFA kicked in when a regular user tried to use the SSPR tool.
