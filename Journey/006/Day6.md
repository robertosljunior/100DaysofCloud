# Configure Office 365 Message Encryption

## Introduction

I worked on this lab because I wanted to know how to protect confidential data such as financial, legal, health, and employee information from being mishandled or accessible by people who shouldn't.
## Use Case

As we all may know, mailboxes can hold large amounts of potentially sensitive information and information leakage can become a serious threat to any organization. With O365 message encryption we can send and receive encrypted email messages between users inside and outside the organization. Learning how to use this tool can help me protect any organization that uses O365 from leakage of sensitive information.

## Cloud Research

I learned how to enable Azure Rights Management for Exchange Online which is is a cloud-based protection service that uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure files and emails across multiple devices, including phones, tablets, and PCs. I also learned how to create a Mail flow Encryption Rule using the Exchange Admin Center.
