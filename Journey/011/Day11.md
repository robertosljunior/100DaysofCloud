# Configure Security and Compliance for Microsoft Teams.

## Introduction

In this lab I learned about setting up Teams governance, data security, and compliance. It included how the data shared in Teams can be regulated according to an specific organization compliance requirement.

## Use Case

Any organization should be able to configure Data governance, data security, and compliance in order to meet certain regulations of the industry it belongs. Microsoft 365 and AzureAD is a great combination to accomplish those tasks. We are able to configure naming policies for Teams groups, Activate Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), configure retention policies, and more.

## Cloud Research

During this lab, I worked on setting up expiration dates for groups with no admins, created retention policies, naming policies that included blocked words, configured ATP for Teams, and configured a GDPR DLP policy.
