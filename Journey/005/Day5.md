# Implement Advanced Threat Protection Policies

## Introduction

I worked on this lab because I wanted to learn how to protect Sharepoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams from malicious links and attachments that might get sent throughout the different apps. 

## Use Case

Microsoft ATP allows you to setup Threat protection policies that helps you set the appropriate level of protection for the organization. Asides from that, it gives you different tools to understand the data and perform better investigations of potential threats.

## Cloud Research

With this project I learn how to create a Safe link and attachment policy. I was also able to validate the policy by sending an "unsafe" link and attachment.
