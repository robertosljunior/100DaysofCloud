# Configured Microsoft Teams collaboration settings

## Cloud Research

Today I worked on configuring Microsoft Teams collaboration settings. It included creating a messaging policy to disable Giphy, Memes, and Stickers. Not fun right? lol. I also worked on disabling third-party storage providers to make sure company data is not being stored in other places without authorization. Finally, added a custom line of a business app to Teams.
