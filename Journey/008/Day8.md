# Deploy Azure VM

## Introduction

I wanted to learn how to deploy an Azure Windows 2019 VM and creating a web server on the VM.

## Use Case

The use case of this lab was to showcase how to deploy the VM and creating a web server on the VM itself that we could use to host our applications or websites.

## Cloud Research

During this lab I was able to use Powershell on the VM to deploy the web server windows feature.
