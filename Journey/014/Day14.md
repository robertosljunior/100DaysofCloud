# Managing Teams communications settings

## Introduction

With this lab I was curious how to configure policies for meetings, live events, and calling. As well as setting up resource accounts for calling queues and auto auto attendants.

## Use Case

* Manage Live events and meeting experiences: With this part of the lab I learned how to edit the default meeting policy and restricted all recording features for meetings. I also learned how to restrict anonymous users from joining meetings. 

* Manage telephony system for Microsoft Teams: In this section I simulated a company that wanted to migrate their PBX system to Teams. I got exposed to creating calling policies that enable voicemail functionalities for a group of users, created calling queue and auto attendant.

## Cloud Research

During this lab I was also able to upload a custom greeting message that will be displayed to users that are transferred to a voicemail. I was unable to test all the functionalities since I don't have a phone system that helps me play with it.
