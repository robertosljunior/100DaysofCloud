# Setting up organization for identity synchronization  

## Introduction

I decided to work on this lab because I wanted to understand how to sync my home AD server with Azure AD. How could I create users locally and sync them with my MS365 tenant? Those are one of the questions that I wanted to find an answer to.

## Use Case

With identity synchronization I have the capability to manage identities or accounts in my local AD server and all updates to user accounts, groups, and contacts are synchronized to my Azure AD tenant. How neat is that?

## Cloud Research

With this project I learn how to configure the Azure AD Connect so it syncs correctly. I also learned how to force a manual sync using Powershell.
