# Introduction to Priviledge Identity Management (PIM)

## Introduction

PIM is an Azure service that helps you manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in the tenant. With PIM we can take advantage of the JIT (Just-in-time) access methodology where we can provide necessary privileges to an user in order to perform an administrative task when needed.

## Use Case

One use case of PIM will be for an organization to minimize the number of people who have access to Azure resources for example. The reason why, it reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access, or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sentitive resource.

With PIM we can enable a lot of cool security features. For example:

* Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates
* Use justification to understand why users activate
* Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles
* Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role
* Get notifications when privileged roles are activated

## Cloud Research

During this lab I learned about enabling PIM, Configured PIM directory roles, performed an access review, and configured PIM approvers to approve/deny requests.
